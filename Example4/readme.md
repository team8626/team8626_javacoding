### Add another implementation of the Arm
    in the arm folder:
        ArmSimple.java: Single Joint
        ArmDual: Dual Joint

## Try to change robot type
    needs to modify several each time in Robot.Java
    
## Problems
    Running the same code on different targets is complicated. 
    Everytime the code need to be modified to know which robot we are building

        - TEST Robot
        - DEV Robot
        - Simulation
