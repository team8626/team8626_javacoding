### Interfaces
    We want all Arm implementation to have at least a similat set of methods.
    interface ArmIO will define the contract of the arm objects

    RobotType can be a variable set at the beginning of the execution
    and the code can deal with building the robot differently but the 
    methods in all the implementation of the arm are the same.

## Problems
